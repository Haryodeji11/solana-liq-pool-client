# üåä Solana Liquidity Pool AMM
A Solana-based Automated Market Maker (AMM) program implemented in Rust, inspired by Raydium, enabling decentralized token swaps, liquidity provision, and pool management on the Solana blockchain.

## üìñ Overview
This project is a Solana program that implements a liquidity pool with AMM functionality. It allows users to:
Initialize a liquidity pool with a token pair (e.g., SOL/USDC).

Add liquidity to the pool and receive liquidity tokens.

Remove liquidity by burning liquidity tokens.

Swap tokens using a constant product formula with a 0.3% fee.

The program is deployed on Solana's devnet and includes a Rust client for testing all instructions.

## ‚ú® Features
InitializePool: Creates a pool with a specified token pair and vault accounts.

AddLiquidity: Deposits tokens into the pool, minting liquidity tokens.

RemoveLiquidity: Burns liquidity tokens to withdraw proportional tokens.

Swap: Executes token swaps with a constant product formula (x * y = k).

Security: Uses Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) for authority, extensive account validation, and custom error handling.

Testing: Includes a Rust client to test all instructions on devnet with real SPL tokens.

## üîß Prerequisites
Rust: cargo, rustc (latest stable).

Solana CLI: solana-cli (version 1.18.9 recommended).

Node.js (optional for additional tooling).

A funded Solana keypair on devnet.

## üöÄ Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/haryodeji11/solana-liq-pool.git
cd solana-liq-pool

Install Dependencies:
bash

cargo build

Configure Solana CLI:
bash

solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

üèóÔ∏è Building and Deploying
Build the Program:
bash

cargo build-bpf

Deploy to Devnet:
bash

solana program deploy target/deploy/solana_liq_pool.so

Note the program ID (e.g., 2SRp5ENH631KzuRGNXWcdLi59pnvKNNoTm37pMRcBH3Q).

üß™ Testing
Set Up Test Client:
bash

cd solana-liquidity-pool-client
cargo build

Create SPL Tokens:
bash

spl-token create-token
spl-token create-account <Token_Mint_Pubkey>
spl-token mint <Token_Mint_Pubkey> 1000000

Repeat for two tokens and vault accounts.

Run Tests:
bash

cargo run

Tests InitializePool, AddLiquidity, RemoveLiquidity, and Swap instructions.

Project Structure
src/lib.rs: Core AMM program with instruction logic and data structures.

solana-liq-pool-client/: Rust client for testing instructions on devnet.

target/deploy/: Compiled .so file for deployment.

Security Considerations
PDA Authority: Ensures only the program can control vault transfers.

Validations: Checks account ownership, writability, and state to prevent unauthorized actions.

No Rug Pull/Honeypot: Code is transparent, with no hidden withdrawal mechanisms.

Future Enhancements
Add slippage protection for swaps.

Implement fee distribution for liquidity providers.

Support program upgrades via BPFLoaderUpgradeable.

Audit for mainnet deployment.
